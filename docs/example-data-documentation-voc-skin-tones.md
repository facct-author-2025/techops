- Tabular Data

### Dataset Description

*Post hoc* skin tone labels of the faces of customers in the [Zalando Voice of Customer (VOC) dataset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Agfx3jpiYHLjssztqZMWl-JtxRDhXfV5BT4ZZXfOcs)
curated as part of the ["Skin Tone Labeling Initiative."](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12wYbrM9dHFXapbeBPZxX3Yh6mvYSzskQs1nmWrlt-Lk/edit#heading=h.va8flzlzpc8h)
The primary purpose of this data is for fairness evaluation purposes:

- to help ensure data used to train ML/AI systems for Size and Fit is representative of Zalando's customers
- to ensure ML/AI systems do not systematically underperform for customers with certain skin tones

(see [Known Dataset Usage - Known Dataset Usage](#known-usage) for more information about known fairness 
evaluations implemented using this dataset).

This data was collected by a team of four Zalando labelers from a mix of teams including
Beauty, Size and Fit, and Algorithmic Privacy and Fairness.  Labelers followed specific
[Skin Tone Labeling Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o56MdP7yFW9aWcLgPu0pbV3fuoWIrHntZ2Dx4AiCRFE/edit),
and labeled each image for skin tone based on the 
[2022 Zalando Beauty skin tone scale](https://www.figma.com/file/XiG4sHJbr8YNNoVUObAcPC/Beauty-Advice---Phase-2?node-id=5208%3A69268&t=yFlqy40lkT8sEvVd-0)
(shown below).

## Example of Data Points
#### Typical Data Point
<!-- width: half -->
<!-- info: Provide an example of a typical data point and describe what makes
it typical.

**Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations.** -->
A typical annotation example from the `labels_per_image` table:

```json
{"annotation_image_id": "10",
 "skin_tone_values": [3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0],
 "labels": [["mid-deep", "deep"],
  ["mid-deep", "deep"],
  ["mid-deep"],
  ["mid-deep"]],
 "uncertain_labels": [false, false, false, false],
 "valid_skin_tone_values": [3.5, 3.5, 3.0, 3.0],
 "any_uncertainty": false,
 "complete_consensus": false,
 "overlap_consensus": true,
 "near_consensus": true,
 "n_skin_tone_values": 4,
 "frac_unique_values": 0.5,
 "n_unique_skin_tone_values": 2,
 "n_connected_skin_tone_groups": 1,
 "skin_tone_mean": 3.25,
 "skin_tone_std": 0.25,
 "has_invalid_annotation": false,
 "skin_tone_mode_value": 3.0,
 "skin_tone_mode_count": 2,
 "n_valid_labels": 4}
```

Here, annotators were not uncertain in their labels, two believed the skin tone was a combination of
`mid-deep` and `deep`, and two thought the skin tone was just `deep` (note neighbouring skin-tone labels 
like `mid-deep` and `deep` were allowed, see [Annotations and Labling](#annotations-and-labeling) 
for more details).

Note, this data corresponds to the main labeling task which only had three labelers. See 
[Annotations and Labeling](#annotations-and-labeling) for more details about labeling tasks.

#### Atypical Data Point
<!-- width: half -->
<!-- info: Provide an example of an outlier data point and describe what makes
it atypical.

**Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations.** -->
An atypical annotation example from the `labels_per_image` table where
the first labeler seemed to have made a mistake by labeled a skin tone as both `light` and `deep`:

```json
{"annotation_image_id": "24",
 "skin_tone_values": [-1.0, 1.5, 0.0],
 "labels": [["light", "deep"], ["mid-light", "medium"], ["light"]],
 "uncertain_labels": [false, false, false],
 "valid_skin_tone_values": [1.5, 0.0],
 "any_uncertainty": false,
 "complete_consensus": false,
 "overlap_consensus": false,
 "near_consensus": false,
 "n_skin_tone_values": 2,
 "frac_unique_values": 1.0,
 "n_unique_skin_tone_values": 2,
 "n_connected_skin_tone_groups": 2,
 "skin_tone_mean": 0.75,
 "skin_tone_std": 0.75,
 "has_invalid_annotation": true,
 "skin_tone_mode_value": 0.0,
 "skin_tone_mode_count": 1}
```

Note, this data corresponds to the calibration 1 labeling task which had more labeling mistakes as labelers 
got used to the labeling UI.  See [Annotations and Labeling](#annotations-and-labeling) for more details about
labeling tasks.

relevant information or considerations. -->
Summarize here. Include links and metrics where applicable.

**Unrepresenting skin tone groups:** Sampling incorrectly risks certain skin tone groups
being underrepresented for skin tone based fairness evaluations.  Ensure all skin tones are
well represented such as to have enough data points to estimate performance
on particular skin tones with a low enough level of uncertainty to be able to draw
reliable fairness conclusions.

section), or the case where a crowd is responsible for collecting and
submitting data independently to form a collective dataset.
-->
- Taken from other existing datasets
- Crowdsourced - Internal Employee (See section on [Annotations and Labeling](#annotations-and-labeling))

**Is this source considered sensitive or high-risk?** Yes

**Dates of Collection:** 2022/12/15 - 2023/03/15

**Update Frequency for collected data:**

- Static

**Additional Links for this collection:**

See section on [Access, Rention, and Deletion](#access-retention-and-deletion)

#### Source Description(s)
<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: Provide a description of each upstream source of data.

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations. -->
- **Source:** [Zalando VOC Skin Tones Dataset](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/skin-tone-labeling?region=eu-central-1&tab=objects)

#### Collection Cadence
<!-- scope: telescope -->
<!-- info: Select **all applicable**: -->
**Static:** Data was collected once from a single source.

### Attribute Collection Criteria and Integration
#### Data Integration
<!-- scope: periscope -->
<!-- info: List all fields collected from different sources, and specify if
they were included or excluded from the dataset.

Use additional notes to
capture any other relevant information or considerations.

(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the following for each upstream
source.)

If included and excluded fields don't apply, just write a short
summary about how data was integrated into this dataset from
upstream sources.

-->
Zalando-VOC images were used as input for labeling.  These images are not generally included in skin tone dataset, but
are identified by image-id to allow for fairness evaluation of systems that use such images.

### Data Point Collection Criteria
#### Data Selection
<!-- scope: telescope -->
<!-- info: Summarize the data selection criteria.

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations. -->
- **Filter out images with bad lighting and occlusions:** done based with
  previously existing annotations done on Zalando VOC data
- **Choose images with >2.5% skin exposure:** This threshold gave balance between being able to see skin,
  and leaving enough images to annotate (~1000) for a fairness evaluation, given the annotation budget

### Relationship to Source
#### Use and Utility(ies)
<!-- scope: telescope -->
<!-- info: Describe how the resulting dataset is aligned with the purposes,
motivations, or intended use of the upstream source(s).

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations.

(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the following for each source type.) -->

section generally describes what benefits come from these usages and the
value system in which those benefits provide value.

-->
- **Zalando VOC images:** This data can be used to ensure ML/AI systems
  that consume Zalando VOC like images do not underperform for certain skin types.
  These skin tone data also inform others of existing skin tone biases in the
  Zalando VOC dataset.

#### Limitation(s) and Trade-Off(s)
<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: What are the limitations of the resulting dataset to its consumers,
compared to the upstream source(s)?

Break down by source type.<br><br>(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the

<!-- scope: periscope -->
<!-- info: Describe any known correlations with the indicated protected
attributes in this dataset.

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations.

(Usage Note: Duplicate for each known correlation.) -->
None identified at this time.

#### Possible Correlations to Protected Attributes
Labeler bias may cause correlations between skin tone labels and attributes of the image not
related to skin tone, such as:

* judgements based on objects in the field of view (i.e. certain objects associated with certain cultures)
* facial shape and body shape
* repeated customers - some customers appear multiple times in separate images and labelers may have
  consistently given each the same incorrect skin tone
* labeler recency bias - seeing a lot of a certain skin color in a row can affect the next label made

#### Risk(s) and Mitigation(s)
<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: Summarize systemic or residual risks, performance expectations,
trade-offs and caveats because of protected attributes in this dataset.

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations.

Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the following for each protected attribute. -->
Some of the possible correlations have been mitigated by:

- having multiple labelers from different backgrounds label each image
- shuffling the data each labeler labels - reducing the labeler recency bias effect 
- making two independent labeler calibration round to have the chance to debug the labeling process
  have discussions about various unconscious labeler biases so each labeler can be mindful and potentially
  prevent introducing these unwanted correlations

See [Annotations and Labeling](#annotations-and-labeling) section for more details.

### Annotation
#### Task(s)
<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: Summarize each task type associated
with annotations in the dataset.

Use additional notes to capture any
other relevant information or
considerations.

(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete
the following for each task type.) -->

**Task description:** Skin tone labelers were asked to label the skin tone
of the human subject appearing in each image by following a particular set of 
[Instructions for Labelers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o56MdP7yFW9aWcLgPu0pbV3fuoWIrHntZ2Dx4AiCRFE)
(more info about who the skin tone labelers where [found below](#human-annotators)).

In short, each labeler labeled each image with one or more skin tone labels from the 
[2022 Zalando Beauty skin tone scale](https://www.figma.com/file/XiG4sHJbr8YNNoVUObAcPC/Beauty-Advice---Phase-2?node-id=5208%3A69268&t=yFlqy40lkT8sEvVd-0)
(shown below).

![](figures/beauty-skin-tone-label-options-plus-uncertain.png)

LabelerAn `uncertain` label was also used by human-labelers that felt uncertain about the label
they chose (for example, `mid-light` + `uncertain`, or just `uncertain` was allowed).

Labelers were allowed to choose two adjacent labels when unsure (for example, `mid-light` + `medium`
was allowed), and labelers had a separate label for indicating they were not sure of the correct label.

The overall labeling work was broken down into four sequential tasks described in the following timeline figure:

![](figures/labeling-tasks.png)
**Figure: Labeling tasks.** 

Labelers were given a two small calibration tasks and after each calibration task, a discussed took place about:

* How long did the task take?
* Were any instructions unclear?
* What, if any, potential biasing factors did you notice, and how might one be mindful about these to mitigate such
  biasing factors?

**Methods used:** Four human labelers with varying backgrounds labeled each image
(see section below on [Human Annotators](#human-annotators)).

**Inter-rater adjudication policy:** Budget permitting, the next version
of the dataset will include results from a labeler review of images
where more than two labelers disagreed.

<!-- Gold questions (i.e., questions with unambiguous, known answers)
are questions that workers are only likely to get wrong if they
don’t clearly understand the annotation criteria. -->
**Golden questions:** No golden questions.

#### Characteristic(s)
<!-- scope: periscope -->
<!-- info: Describe relevant characteristics of annotations
