## Overview

### Model Type
Convolutional Neural Network

### Model Description
<!-- info: Brief (max 200 words) description of the model architecture and the task(s) it was trained to solve. -->
**A**ccurate and **Li**ghtweight mobile human **S**egmentation **Net**work (ALiSNet) is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for semantic segmentation of human silhouettes from photos.
Architecture of ALiSNet is based on [Semantic FPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02446) with [PointRend](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08193) refinement. The original backbone of the network is exchanged by mobile-optimized [MnasNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11626) to achieve significant model size reduction. Additionaly, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) from the original backbone is replaced with a simpler aggregation step, skipping FPN top-down path. Final model is also quantized to 8 bits integer precision using Qantization Aware Training.

### Status
**Status Date:** 2025-01-22

**Regularly Updated** - New versions of the model have been or will continue to be made available.

## Intended and Known Usage
<!-- info: The model owners are not expected to track all applications that use this model.-->
### Intended Use
<!-- info: This section focuses on the initial purpose and/or reasoning
for creating the model.-->

Model was developed to perform semantic segmentation of humans vs. background as a step in inference of body 
measurements from photos. Given the specific use case, 
ALiSNet was trained to work for very narrow arm and leg angles ranges.

### Out of Scope Uses

ALiSNet was trained to work for very narrow arm and leg angles ranges. It shouldn't be used for general semantic segmentation tasks of human silhouettes vs. background.

### Known Applications

current known usages.

## Risks and Ethical Considerations

Privacy risks were initially reviewed by Size & Fit ([Malte Alf](mailto:malte.alf@zalando.ch), [Amrollah Seifoddini](mailto:amrollah.seifoddini@zalando.ch), [Timon Kuenzle](mailto:timon.kuenzle@zalando.ch), [Stefan Messmer](mailto:stefan.messmer@zalando.ch)) in collaboration with Algorithmic Privacy & Fairness ([Håkan Jonsson](mailto:hakan.jonsson@zalando.de)) and Product Security ([Daniel Calderon](mailto:daniel.calderon@zalando.de)).

#### Processing or storage of customer photos during deployment

In order to obtain measurments customers need to upload their photos to our app so that their silhouette may be inferred. This creates a risk related to storage and processing of private data.

**Mitigation strategy:**

ALiSNet is deployed on-device. Customers photos are processed and stored on their device and Zalando does not have access to them. Only inferred silhouettes are sent to Zalando servers.

#### On-device deployment

Deploying ALiSNet on-device may cause risks related to backdoor attacks against ML models such as Membership Inference or Model Inversion which may result in violation of privacy of our customers.

**Mitigation strategy:**

[Privacy risk assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXFrcyWblFIHLw9uOXsla8e-zBhtFwlgIBH84MdvrrM/edit?usp=sharing) was performed in order to quantify Membership Inference (MIA) risk of the ALiSNet.
As of November 2022 results of the audit showed that MIA risk is none to low.

#### Biases in model performance
Statistically relevant discrepancies in the model accuracy across protected attributes related to human characteristics such as age, percieved skin tone, height etc..

**Mitigation Strategy:**

[Fairnes assessment](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DhjDdjWzgIkkjhVg1-AM9VzibCK27kW1kpUEDim3CMA/edit?usp=sharing) was performed in order to qunatify potential discerpancies across derived skin tone and body shape.
As of October 2022 no relevant discrepencies in model performance were found.

## Training
<!-- info: This section should include overview regarding training process such as training dataset(s), training task (ex. next token prediciton, pixel-wise classification). -->
ALiSNet is a classification model trained on semantic segmentation task which goal is to perform a classification of pixels in the input image with corresponding semantic class (human, bike etc.).

See [ALiSNet Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07533) for more details about training.

## Caveats and Recommendations
Poor lightning conditions and low photo resolution may decrease quality of segmentation. (?)

The model was designed with strong size and latency constraints and is ready to be deployed to production or edge devices.
