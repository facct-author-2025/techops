#### How:

Create a data dictionary:
    

- Document dataset structure, column descriptions, data types, and relationships.
    

Track schema changes:
    

- Use tools like dbt or Great Expectations to log schema evolution.
    
- Record changes as part of version control or data pipelines.
    

 Save metadata alongside datasets:
    

- Use JSON, YAML, or similar formats to store metadata files.
    
- Include details like source, timestamp, description, version, and quality metrics.
    
  

 #### Incorporate Data Lineage Tools
    
 Why: Data lineage tools provide end-to-end visibility of data transformations and dependencies.

#### How:

- Integrate tools like OpenLineage, Talend, or Alation.
    
- Track data movement: From ingestion to transformation to storage.
    
-  Visualise: Lineage graphs showing how different dataset versions relate.

#### Bias Detection Methods Used:
    

**Preprocessing:** Resampling, Reweighting,Transformation (data imputation, changing order of data); Relabeling, Blinding
    
**In-processing:** Transfer learning, Reweighting, Constraint optimization, Adversarial Learning, Regularization, Bandits
    
**Post-processing:** Transformation, Calibration, Thresholding
    

  

**Results of Bias Testing:**
    

#### Mitigation Measures:
    

**Fairness adjustments:** Introduce fairness criteria (like demographic parity, equal opportunity, or equalized odds) into the model training process.Â 
    
**Adversarial Debiasing:** Use adversarial networks to remove biased information during training. The main model tries to make accurate predictions, while an adversary network tries to predict sensitive attributes from the model's predictions.
    

#### Retraining approaches:Â 

**Fairness Regularization:** Modify the model's objective function to penalize bias. This introduces regularization terms that discourage the model from making predictions that disproportionately affect certain groups.
    
**Fair Representation Learning:** Learn latent representations of the input data that remove sensitive attributes, ensuring that downstream models trained on these representations are fair.
    
Post-Processing Techniques:

**Fairness-Aware Recalibration:** After the model is trained, adjust decision thresholds separately for different demographic groups to reduce disparities in false positive/false negative rates.
    
**Output Perturbation:** Introduce randomness or noise to model predictions to make outcomes more equitable across groups.
    
**Fairness Impact Statement:** Explain trade-offs made to satisfy certain fairness criterias
    

#### 4.6 Model Interpretability and Explainability

**Explainability Techniques Used:**
    

- Shapley values, LIME, etc.
    
**Post-hoc Explanation Models**

  

- Feature Importance (Permutation Importance, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):
    
- Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
    
- Counterfactual Explanations
    
- Surrogate Models
    
- Attention Mechanisms (for Deep Learning)
    

  

**Model-Specific Explanation Techniques**

  

- Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)
    
- Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
    
- TreeSHAP (SHAP for Decision Trees)
    

  
  

How interpretable is the modelâ€™s decision-making process?
